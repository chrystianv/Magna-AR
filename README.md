 # Magna-AR

 This app, designed to educate students in high school and higher education about 3-D magnetic fields, is funded by the Cyberlearning program of the National Science Foundation, grant [NSF#1822728](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1822728&HistoricalAwards=false).

Physics Toolbox AR combines the data collected by the internal magnetometer with the three-dimensional mapping of ARCore to plot magnetic fields in real space superimposed upon the camera view.



Useful for students and teachers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education and academic or industrial researchers, this app helps users to visualize magnetic fields based upon real sources—not prepared computational models—without the use of external sensors.



The actual total magnitude of the magnetic field at real points in space can be visualized with color-coded vectors or spheres to see changes in magnitude. A menu allows the user to learn more about the operating principles of the magnetometer, display compass directions in the field of view, and change settings to display/remove magnetic field values and modify the color key.
